 I am not familiar with that
particular position, but let me say in response, the reality is, there
is an $11 billion surplus in the highway trust fund.
The problem with the highway trust fund is not the EPA regulation. It
is our fiscal imprudence so that we take that highway trust fund and
try to pretend we are balancing the budget with that.
