 I just want to make a few final
points, and then yield the floor.
The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] made a point that we import
palladium from Russia. I am not sure what the rationale is for his
concern. I assume if we import anything from Russia, we should not
impose a tax to try to curb that practice.
Russia is a big gold producer. If we wind up importing gold, under
the rationale of the Senator from Nevada, there never would be a
royalty on gold because we could get it from Russia. To invoke the cold
war to try to keep doing what we have been doing for 122 years, which
is the biggest scam in America, is an outrage.
In addition, approximately 75 to 80 percent of the gold mined in this
country goes into jewelry? I have nothing against jewelry. I tell you,
I have never worn a ring in my life. I have never worn a bracelet. I do
not personally care anything about jewelry. But I do not criticize
those who do. But here we are, giving away precious minerals, billions
of dollars' worth of gold, to subsidize jewelry producers.
