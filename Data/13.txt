 If the gentleman will yield further, it may well be that
those bills are outstanding and do need to be paid. I certainly would
hope that they would be.
However, the budget that we are submitting today is for 1995, for the
next fiscal year, and I believe that the budget request that has been
made is a reasonable one. HIS is really a utility to us.
