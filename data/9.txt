 Speaker, the White House says that the President's
original explanation of the First Lady's dealings in the futures market
are no longer operative. On April 15 Americans will learn that the
administration has no more credibility on retroactive taxes than it
does on cattle futures. The White House says that Democrats raised
taxes only on 1 percent of the population. But the facts do not support
this spin.
No. 1, senior citizens with incomes over $34,000 will face a 70-
percent income tax increase on their benefits. They, of course, are not
rich, but, as Republicans warn, this President defines rich as anyone
who owns a wallet.
No. 2, new taxes on motor fuel will disproportionately miss the rich,
as this chart shows. Those with incomes below $30,000 will bear 29
percent of the burden, and those with incomes between $30,000 and
$75,000 will bear a staggering 46 percent of the burden; 75 percent of
the burden of this tax falls on people with incomes under $75,000.
Mr. Speaker, the Democrat Party line is that they only raise taxes on
the rich, but the middle class knows that the statement is no longer
operative, and the middle class also knows that the Democrats cannot be
trusted with either words or numbers.
